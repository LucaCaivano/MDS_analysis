The project, in collaboration with Humanitas, had to purpose to analyze medical data coming from patients affected by Myelodisplastic Syndrome: a rare deasese that can progress into Acute Myeloid Leukemia, had very high mortality and for which only cure is trasplantation. Our main goal was to investigate the effect of trasplantation relying on classical statistical inference method and some non-parametrized statistical method such as survival analysis. Moreover we used an innovative approach based on Neural Networks and clustering in order to clusterize patients based on theit mortality risk and trying to predict the time of survival. The code can be found in different directories, taking into account tha data are missing for NDA agreement.
